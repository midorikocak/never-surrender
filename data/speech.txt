When
Napoleon
lay
at
Boulogne
for
a
year
with
his
flat-bottomed
boats
and
his
Grand
Army,
he
was
told
by
someone,
"there
are
bitter
weeds
in
England.
"
There
are
certainly
a
great
many
more
of
them
since
the
British
Expeditionary
Force
returned.
So
I
have,
myself,
full
confidence
that
if
all
do
their
duty,
if
nothing
is
neglected,
and
if
the
best
arrangements
are
made,
as
they
are
being
made,
we
shall
prove
ourselves
once
more
able
to
defend
our
Island
Home,
to
ride
out
the
storm
of
war,
and
to
outlive
the
menace
of
tyranny,
if
necessary
for
years,
if
necessary
alone.
At
any
rate,
that
is
what
we
are
going
to
try
to
do.

That
is
the
resolve
of
His
Majesty’s
Government
-every
man
of
them.

That
is
the
will
of
Parliament
and
the
nation.
The
British
Empire
and
the
French
Republic,
linked
together
in
their
cause
and
in
their
need,
will
defend
to
the
death
their
native
soil,
aiding
each
other
like
good
comrades
to
the
utmost
of
their
strength.
Even
though
large
tracts
of
Europe
and
many
old
and
famous
States
have
fallen
or
may
fall
into
the
grip
of
the
Gestapo
and
all
the
odious
apparatus
of
Nazi
rule,
we
shall
not
flag
or
fail.
We
shall
go
on
to
the
end,
we
shall
fight
in
France,
We
shall
fight
on
the
seas
and
oceans,
We
shall
fight
with
growing
confidence
and
growing
strength
in
the
air,
we
shall
defend
our
Island,
whatever
the
cost
may
be,
We
shall
fight
on
the
beaches,
We
shall
fight
on
the
landing
grounds,
We
shall
fight
in
the
fields
and
in
the
streets,
We
shall
fight
in
the
hills;We
shall
never
surrender,
and
even
if,
which
I
do
not
for
a
moment
believe,
this
Island
or
a
large
part
of
it
were
subjugated
and
starving,
then
our
Empire
beyond
the
seas,
armed
and
guarded
by
the
British
Fleet,
would
carry
on
the
struggle,
until,
in
God’s
good
time,
the
New
World,
with
all
its
power
and
might,
steps
forth
to
the
rescue
and
the
liberation
of
the
old.
